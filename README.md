No snippet directly addresses your question about the instructions for the challenge in lesson 32. However, based on the course content, here’s what your instructor wants you to do:

Navigate to the Website: Start by going to the Wet Driver University's homepage.

Perform Login Actions: You need to click on the login button.

Validate Scenarios:

First scenario: Use valid credentials and confirm you receive the expected message.
Second scenario: Use invalid credentials (either username or password) and check for the failure message.
Create a Feature File: Inside the e2e folder, you are to create a new feature file named log.feature to implement the login scenarios.

Add Scenario Outlines: You may use scenario outlines to structure your test cases. This will allow you to easily add more testing scenarios without repeating code.

Keep it DRY: Follow the ‘Don’t Repeat Yourself’ principle when setting up your scenarios.

Try breaking down these tasks into smaller steps and implement them systematically. If you need further clarification, let me know!

## credentials

As per the instructions provided in the course, the valid credentials for the login scenario are:

Username: webdriver
Password: webdriver123
Using these credentials, when you click the login button, you should be presented with a success message indicating validation succeeded. If you use any other password with the same username, you will encounter a validation failure message.
